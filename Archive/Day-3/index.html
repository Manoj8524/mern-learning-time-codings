        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
        since the <span style="color: red">1500s</span>, when an unknown printer
        took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It
        has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
        typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
        1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
        passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
        PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
